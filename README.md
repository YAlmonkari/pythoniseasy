main.py - Python is easy cours Project 1 - a Conanect4 game.

I have managed to code the game it self (connect 4 by hasbro), -dots (x and o) are placed in columns.
The board x-es and o-s is saved as a set of " ", x and o-s.
The check function is made with the assist of google AI tool Bard.

poker.py - Final Pirple project - card game.
Not at all functional.
