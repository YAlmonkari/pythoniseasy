main.py - Python is easy cours Project 1 - a simple game

I have managed to code the game it self (connect 4 by hasbro), -dots (x and o) are placed in columns.
The board x-es and o-s is saved as a set of " ", x and o-s. 
I have no idea how to check who won.

My idea is to check last row for xxxx-es, than another but I am stuck.
Function check should check for winner.

poker.py - Final Pirple project - card game.
